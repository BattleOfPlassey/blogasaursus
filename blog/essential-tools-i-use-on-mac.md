### 1. Maccy 
[Maccy](https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy) is a lightweight clipboard manager for macOS and lifesaver tool for me. It keeps the history of what you copy and lets you quickly navigate, search, and use previous clipboard contents.

### 2. Homebrew
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is **The Missing Package Manager for macOS** as it helps install [the stuff you need](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ "List of Homebrew packages") that Apple didn’t provide. After installing Homebrew you can simply install a number of softwares in one go with a single command like below.

```bash
brew install --cask firefox chrome postman dbeaver
```

So No more “To install, drag this icon…”.
