##### 1. The .gitignore added by tina is blocking upload

We add a .gitignore to the admin folder so that the admin folder does
 not get committed to your repo. Depending on how you are using Github 
Pages you may need to run rm \<YourPublicFolder>/admin/.gitignore to remove the .gitignore file.




<CodeBlock language="YAML" title="deploy.yml">
        \- name: Remove gitignore file

           run: rm ./build/admin/.gitignore


</CodeBlock>
