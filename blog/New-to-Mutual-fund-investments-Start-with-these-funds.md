Mutual funds give investors access to a wider range of investments. However, investing in them might be difficult, particularly for beginners.

<!--truncate-->

Start with **index funds** if you're fresh to the world of mutual funds. Beginners sometimes commit the error of chasing the fund with the highest return from the previous year, even though this strategy frequently fails to hold its position over time. Instead, begin by investing in an index fund.

An index fund is a type of mutual fund or exchange-traded fund that aims to mimic the performance of a market index. Compared to actively managed funds, it has reduced costs and fees. It adopts a passive investment approach and aims to match the market's risk and return on the assumption that the market will outperform all individual investments over the long run.

Second, As investors gain confidence and experience, use **flexi-cap funds** to advance to the next level. These funds have the advantage of having qualified fund managers choose the best companies, so you don't have to worry about market cap choices.

It is noteworthy that flexi-cap funds invest in businesses with market capitalizations ranging from large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks.

Finally, **hybrid funds** are the best option for investors looking for a balanced approach to investing. These funds maintain the possibility of growth through stocks while striking a healthy balance between equities and bonds. They offer diversification to manage risk during market downturns.

As their name implies, hybrid funds invest in a mix of different asset classes. These could be debt/fixed deposit types of securities, equity, and commodities.
