I create them, I work closely with a React Native development team and we develop iOS apps for internal business users. Also, I spend a lot of time on my phone. And I want to share my observations so you don’t spend a lot of time and money building an app that doesn’t advance your business goals (or may even hurt them).</p><p>Let’s start with some challenges.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="1-a-bad-app-damages-your-brand">1. A bad app damages your brand<a href="#1-a-bad-app-damages-your-brand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. A bad app damages your brand" title="Direct link to 1. A bad app damages your brand">​</a></h3><p>A cheap app performs poorly, feels bulky, and frustrates user every time they use it. <strong>If you can’t or won’t spend the money to do it right, don’t build a mobile app</strong>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="2-a-not-so-useful-app-doesnt-grow-your-brand">2. A not so useful app doesn’t grow your brand<a href="#2-a-not-so-useful-app-doesnt-grow-your-brand" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. A not so useful app doesn’t grow your brand" title="Direct link to 2. A not so useful app doesn’t grow your brand">​</a></h3><p>Let’s say you create an app, and while it is beautiful and easy to use, it’s also useless. That sounds harsh. What I mean is, the functions it provides are not ones that users need or will want to take on their phone.</p><p><strong>If you can’t come up with a compelling use case that screams, “You gotta do this on a phone!”, don’t build a mobile app.</strong></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="3-the-competition-is-tough">3. The competition is tough<a href="#3-the-competition-is-tough" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. The competition is tough" title="Direct link to 3. The competition is tough">​</a></h3><p>The final question to answer before creating a mobile app is, “Who is my competition?” The answer is <em>not</em> the companies that are in your product market. The answer is <em>every other mobile app</em>. If someone is on another app, they’re not in yours. So your competitors are Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Mail, Text, Maps and even the calendar app.</p><p>That’s what you have to fight. If you’re not the reason the user is pulling out their phone, then your app is never going to be opened, and eventually, it will get uninstalled.</p><p><strong>If you can’t come with a rock-solid reason why a user would choose to open your app instead of something else, don’t build a mobile app.</strong></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="4-the-road-to-success-is-dark-and-full-of-terrors">4. The Road to Success is dark and full of (t)errors<a href="#4-the-road-to-success-is-dark-and-full-of-terrors" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4. The Road to Success is dark and full of (t)errors" title="Direct link to 4. The Road to Success is dark and full of (t)errors">​</a></h3><p>Users make quick decisions about whether to keep an app on their phone or uninstall it w/o reason. The reasons range from (“I didn’t like the colours”) to (“It crashed when I launched it”) to (“I don’t get what it does” ) and lastly ("There is too many ads").</p><p>Once a user has removed your app, that’s the end of the road. No amount of new feature enhancements or fixes will bring them back: they’re GONE.</p><p><strong>If your plans don’t include an approach for winning over users quickly, don’t build a mobile app.</strong></p><p>In conclusion, Understand the challenges, question your assumptions vigilantly, and only build a mobile app if you can answer why you’re building it, how your customers will use it, and why they’ll want to launch it and love it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The extend to which conformity stifles creativity depends upon the nature of the job being executed, the temperament of each individual and the final goal to be achieved. I am in full agreement that conformity stifles creativity; indeed they both are mutually exclusive. </p><p>Some people are conformist by nature. Whether conformity stifles individual energy depends on the individual person. Where teamwork is key, they function best in an environment where their role is well defined. For conformists , they share a common goal, purpose or mission with a group that must work together as cogs in a machine to achieve that mission. In the military or any sports, each individual is responsible to play and conform to group’s common mission or goal. And rather than quelling energy, this conformity breeds camaraderie, as well as fervor and enthusiasm for winning a battle or the game. Besides, non-conformity in these situations only serves to undermine success; if game-plan or battle strategies were left to each individuals or participants, the results would be disastrous.</p><p>Conformist find enhanced energy in certain corners of the business world as well, particularly in traditional services like finance, retail, sales, accounting, insurance, legal-services and healthcare. In these business, iconoclasts find no place to revel and thrive but rather those individual who can work most effectively within the constraints of established practices, policies and regulations. Of course a clever idea or tactic might help turn tides during a meeting for structuring a deal, or a creative legal maneuver, might play a simple role in winning smaller battles along the way. But such tactics are of those conformists who are playing by the same ground rules as their peers.</p><p>In sharp contrast, other people are non-conformist by nature. These people are motivated by the personal satisfaction that comes with creativity, innovation and invention of novel ideas. For these individual, a highly structured and sophisticated bureaucratic environment only serves to quell motivation and energy. Artists and musicians even find these type of environments stifling and even noxious. Entrepreneurial business people who thrive on this innovation and differentiation often driven to self-employment because they feel stifled and frustrated, even offended, by the bureaucracy which requires conformity.</p><p>As for conformity stifling individual creativity, we need to look at another example. Our most creative people are highly eccentric in their personal appearance, lifestyle and so forth. In fact they seem to eschew any form of conformity, established norms and mores.   Lady Gaga known for her eccentric appearance at the renowned music award functions. Michael Jackson, most creative force in popular music culture is nothing if not non-conforming in every way. Besides, by definition creativity begs non-conformity. In other words, any creative act is necessary to be in non-conformance with what already exists.</p><p>To sum up, conformists find their energy by conforming and non-conformists by not conforming. And creativity is the exclusive domain of non-conformists.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Questioning and challenging the assertions of others has proven to be effective in the process of learning]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Too much emphasis has been placed on the need for students to challenge the assertions of others. <!-- -->Some say social harmony should be the goal of every school. It is erroneous to place an overemphasis on either side as I believe that it is essential to promote a healthy balance between the two.</p><p>As we move away from traditional ways of learning, more students are being encouraged to raise questions and challenge the assertions of others in order to test and validate established facts as well as deepen their understanding of the subject matter. During older times, especially during the times when religious institutions were the primary source of education, students were taught to accept facts without questioning much, which led to a decay of the intellect, as proved in many instances in history.</p><p>Questioning and challenging the assertions of others has proven to be effective in the process of learning. Questioning is one of the oldest forms of learning. From the philosophical form of inquiry preached by Socrates to the intellectual revolution of the Renaissance era, it is very obvious that independent thought and ideas are essential for making new discoveries and progress, and schools should not promote a curriculum that impedes this. However, how much is considered too much? Placing an emphasis for students to challenge the assertions of others can promote critical thinking, deeper understanding and competition. Too much emphasis on it can impede the process of learning and foster unhealthy competition between the students and the teachers, which, as implied by the topic statement, could affect social harmony adversely.</p><p>On the other hand, students should practice moderation in challenging the assertions of their peers and teachers. Established facts and information that are provided in educational institutions are the product of the discoveries made by our forefathers, which have been tested and proven at one time. A student should learn the basic tenets of academic disciplines before challenging and questioning unnecessarily. How can the student debate the complex ideas and proven theories if the student does not even have the basic knowledge of the subject matter? Also, it is undeniable that the ability and compromise and work with others is an important aspect in the process of learning. The synergy of teamwork is beneficial to a conducive learning atmosphere. As the saying goes, “Two heads are better than one.” If too much time is spent on debating and questioning , no work would get done, ill feelings would be fostered and as a result no progress would be made. Therefore, schools should make a healthy balance of debate and compromise as a major goal.</p><p>In conclusion, I do not believe that the ability to achieve social harmony should be the major goal of all schools. Schools should seek to promote a fine balance between encouraging their students to challenge assertions and their ability to compromise and work together.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Questioning and challenging the assertions of others]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I strongly agree with the assertion that significant advances in knowledge require expertise from various fields. The world around us presents a seamless web of physical and anthropocentric forces, which interact in ways that can be understood only in the context of a variety of disciplines. </p><p>Two examples that aptly illustrate this point involve the fields of cultural anthropology and astronomy. Consider how a cultural anthropologist's knowledge about an ancient civilization is enhanced not only by the expertise of the archeologist-who unearths the evidence-but ultimately by the expertise of biochemists, geologists, linguists, and even astronomers. By analyzing the hair, nails, blood, and bones of mummified bodies, biochemists and forensic scientists can determine the life expectancy, general wellbeing, and common causes of death of the population. These experts can also ensure the proper preservation of evidence found at the archeological site. A geologist can help identify the source and age of the materials used for tools, weapons, and structures thereby enabling the anthropologist to extrapolate about the civilization's economy, trades and work habits, lifestyles, extent of travel and mobility, and so forth. Linguists are needed to interpret hieroglyphics and extrapolate from found fragments of writings. And an astronomer can help explain the layout of an ancient city as well as the design, structure and position of monuments, tombs, and temples-since ancients often looked to the stars for guidance in building cities and structures.</p><p>An even more striking example of how expertise in diverse fields is needed to advance knowledge involves the area of astronomy and space exploration. Significant advancements in our knowledge of the solar system and the universe require increasingly keen tools for observation and measurement. Telescope technology and the measurement of celestial distances, masses, volumes, and so forth, are the domain of astrophysicists.These advances also require increasingly sophisticated means of exploration. Manned and unmanned exploratory probes are designed by mechanical, electrical, and computer engineers. And to build and enable these technologies requires the acumen and savvy of business leaders, managers, and politicians. Even diplomats might play a role-insofar as major space projects require international cooperative efforts among the world's scientists and governments. And ultimately it is our philosophers whose expertise helps provide meaning to what we learn about our universe.</p><p>In sum, no area of intellectual inquiry operates in a vacuum. Because the sciences are inextricably related, to advance our knowledge in any one area we must understand the interplay among them all. Moreover, it is our non-scientists who make possible the science, and who bring meaning to what we learn from it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[How do you define a Great nation]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A nation is a feeling of collective belonging to an identity by its resident which has common language, culture, race, religion or territory. <!-- -->A nation is the culmination of a long past of endeavors, sacrifice and devotion of its great heroes, leaders, scientists, artists and most importantly its general public. The author’s point that the indicator of any great nation is represented by the achievements in general welfare of society and not by the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists is true to some extent. However I believe that the achievements of a nation's rulers, artists and scientists are synonymous to the general welfare of the people, instead of being separate as implied above.</p><p>How do you define a Great nation?  To have common glories in the past, to have a common will in the present, to have performed great deeds together, to wish to perform still more, these are the essential conditions of a being a Great Nation.  A nation is therefore a large-scale solidarity, its existence is a daily plebiscite, and the existence of nations is a good thing, a necessity even. The real indicators of a great Nation could be its Quality of Life, Human Rights Development Index, Happiness Index, GDP, political freedom, personal safety, education systems, public health care, and high standards of living.</p><p>As an illustration, let us look at two very different countries: Switzerland and Myanmar. Switzerland has been ranked among one of the countries that provide the highest standards of living in the world, which is inclusive of an efficient health care system and free education for all their citizens. Their success is reflected in their social, political and economic stability. On the other hand, Myanmar is a complete opposite representation of Switzerland. A country that has been backed by a harsh autocratic military regime for years, the citizens of Myanmar have long been oppressed and denied of many basic human rights. Even though the country is rich with natural resources, the people do not enjoy any of the wealth that comes with it. Instead they live in poor and squalid conditions. These conditions, on top of their lack of political freedom have led to many social uprising, which has most recently culminated into the public demonstrations by the monks in Yangon. By using the example of these two countries, it is fair to say that the general welfare of a nation's people is the surest indicator of a great/successful nation.</p><p>Consider the case in India. It has an enormous population and it achieved independence less than a century ago. A general overview of the welfare of its people will bring out the low average income, food scarcity and low literacy levels. These are all true but situations improve over time. It has one of the best educated people in the world and a highly modern telecommunication infrastructure. In this particular case, we should also look closely at the contributions of individuals from various fields. Ramanujan, an unorthodox mathematician, put India into the map of modern mathematics. Nobel Prize winner C.V. Raman’s contributions to physics displayed the technical prowess of India. Satyajit Ray won the lifetime achievement Oscar award for his excellence in cinema. Father of the Nation and Bharat Ratna, Mahatma Gandhi was one of the strongest freedom movement activist the world produced. There are plenty of examples to show that India is a great nation, not by virtue of the state of the people, but due to the outstanding contributions made by pioneers within the country. Hence, in certain cases, the achievements of rulers, artists or scientists can speak for the greatness of a nation.</p><p>As a conclusion, A nation that provides well for its people has the potential for a nation to grow into greatness; it promotes a conducive ground for political, economic and social growth. The achievements of a nation's rulers, artists and scientists are important indicators of a great nation as well but their achievements are tied to the general welfare of the society.</p>]]></content:encoded>
